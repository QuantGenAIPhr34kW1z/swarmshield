# USSR 1985-1991: Perestroika - The Chinese Path Not Taken
# =============================================================================
#
# COUNTERFACTUAL QUESTION:
#   Could the USSR have followed the Chinese model - stable economic
#   liberalization without political collapse?
#
# HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
#   - Gorbachev becomes General Secretary (March 1985)
#   - Glasnost (openness) and Perestroika (restructuring) launched
#   - Nationalist movements emerge in Baltic states, Caucasus, Ukraine
#   - August 1991 coup attempt fails
#   - USSR dissolves December 1991
#
# CHINESE COMPARISON:
#   - Deng Xiaoping's reforms began 1978
#   - Economic liberalization WITHOUT political opening
#   - Tiananmen 1989: Suppressed political challenge
#   - CCP maintained control while economy grew
#
# INTERVENTION HYPOTHESIS:
#   What if Gorbachev had pursued economic reform BEFORE political opening?
#   What if nationalist movements were addressed earlier?
#   What if hardliners had been managed differently?
#
# BELIEF DIMENSIONS:
#   0: Support for Communist Party (negative = opposition)
#   1: Nationalist sentiment (positive = independence desire)
#   2: Economic reform support (positive = pro-market)
#   3: Democratic aspiration (positive = wants democracy)

# =============================================================================
# ANALYSIS NOTES:
#
# Key phases to observe:
# 1. t=0-20: Early reforms, glasnost begins
# 2. t=20-40: Nationalist movements emerge
# 3. t=40-60: Economic crisis deepens
# 4. t=60-78: Collapse or stabilization?
#
# Chinese path requirements:
# - Economic reform WITHOUT political opening (reduce glasnost effect)
# - Early suppression of nationalist movements
# - Maintain party legitimacy through economic growth
# - Manage hardliners without coup
#
# Counterfactual interventions:
# - Delay glasnost, prioritize economic reform
# - Earlier autonomy concessions to republics
# - Different handling of Baltic independence movements
# - Economic aid from West in exchange for stability
#
# Success metrics for "Chinese path":
# - legitimacy_index > 0.35 at end
# - violence_risk_index < 0.40
# - No cascade events causing republic secession
# - cluster_count < 8 (maintain union cohesion)
